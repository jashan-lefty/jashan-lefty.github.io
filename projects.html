            <p>The project is a React-based web application designed to demonstrate the integration of a
                Jenkins pipeline for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). The goal is to
                automate the entire process of building, testing, code quality analysis, deployment, and
                production release. React is used for building the user interface, providing a dynamic and

            <h3>Ping using icmplib</h3>
            <p>This Python project allows users to ping multiple hostnames and check their availability. 
                Using the icmplib library, it sends four ICMP packets to the selected host, measuring response times and determining whether the host is reachable. The program starts with a predefined list of websites and lets users add more. 
                It then displays the list and prompts users to select a hostname by index to initiate the ping. 
                The program handles errors such as invalid input and unreachable hosts gracefully, ensuring robustness. This project enhances troubleshooting skills and helps in network diagnostics.</p>
            <p>ðŸ“Œ Skills & Tools: Python, icmplib, loop structures for automation</p>

            <p>This is a python code that will create custom ICMP packets and send requests to any domain for ping. 
                In this task, I created my own ping application, where I can ping IP and domain names of different websites, I used socket programming in Python to develop the code, although there were many challenges that I had to encounter and 
                I had to take some help to understand the logic of Checksum calculation. Overall, there was a lot to learn from this task.</p>

            <h3>Creating a DNS Server</h3>
            <img src="images/DNS.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;" alt="Scripting Project">
            <p> This Python script simulates a local DNS server using UDP on port 53. The server listens for incoming hostname queries from clients and responds with predefined IP addresses and CNAME (Canonical Name) records stored in a dictionary. If a hostname matches an entry in the dictionary, the server returns the corresponding IP and CNAME; otherwise, it replies with "Host not found." 
                This project demonstrates DNS resolution simulation and socket programming for network security research and testing.</p>

            <img src="images/Firewall.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"  alt="Scripting Project">
            <p> In this challenge, I analyzed the Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965) vulnerability, investigated security bypasses, and wrote an Incident Postmortem Report detailing the detection, impact, and resolution of the attack. 
                I also implemented a firewall rule in Python to block malicious requests and prevent future exploitation.</p>

            <img src="images/AWS.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"  alt="Machine learning">
            <p> This project involves deploying a highly available WordPress application on AWS using services like EC2, RDS, ELB, S3, 
                and CloudFormation. A custom VPC is created with public and private subnets, routing traffic via NAT and IGW. An RDS MySQL 
                8.0.35 instance is set up in a private subnet, while an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in public subnets distributes traffic to EC2 instances hosting WordPress. These instances, launched with Amazon Linux 2, use user data scripts for setup and integrate with an S3 bucket for media storage. An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with a Launch Template dynamically adjusts instances based on CPU utilization, deploying them into private subnets. CloudFormation templates manage the infrastructure, ensuring scalability and resilience. Testing includes verifying ALB access, 
                ASG scaling, S3 integration, and RDS Multi-AZ functionality, demonstrating a robust AWS-hosted WordPress architecture.</p>
